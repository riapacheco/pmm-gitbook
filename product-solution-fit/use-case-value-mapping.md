# Use-Case/Value Mapping

This activity will map the different features / services offered against the workflows our customers are trying to address. To illustrate the importance of this, it's not uncommon for internal staff members to describe a driving feature or capability of a platform without first understanding similar tools offered in the market. This might result in their mistaking a product element for a "feature", which does not speak to the greater product expectations that should be communicated first (and that the market understands). To avoid this, complete the following mapping workflow below.

## Mapping Workflow

Follow this workflow for an evolving intuition that would result in a solid understanding of offerings.

### Step 1: Identify Elements

Identify each part of the tool as an element with a standardized description. Those that have higher impact on customer outcomes might have user workflows attached to them or highlighted in some way to enable future re-focusing.&#x20;

### Step 2: Revisit Competitor and Industry Tools

Revisiting alternative tools, that customers are typically exposed to, helps us understand the natural expectations of each customer when first approaching solutions within the buying cycle.&#x20;

### Step 3: Uncover Core Value Propositions&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Click here for a quick rundown on the problem Cold Bore Technology is addressing</summary>

Cold Bore Technology is a data management solution for Oil & Gas companies looking to collect data from all contractors involved in an operation that stimulates well activity for maximized hydrocarbon output (the stuff needed to create pretty much everything around you - not just what's in your fuel take). During this operation, all the activities performed onsite are done entirely by outsourced service companies. These companies use completely different tools & methods for tracking and submitting their data, which really complicates things for the operator when building actionable intelligence systems.

When all is said and done, there should be (at minimum) three different value propositions that can be posited to the customer. These are typically measurable and speak directly to solving customer problems.

Here are some examples from those value propositions I implemented at Cold Bore Technology:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Value Proposition 1" %}
#### Collect and Format Diverse Pad Data from Separate Service Partners

Run your daily ops meeting with shared look-backs into critical indicators, NPT stats, and activity overview summaries.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Value Proposition 2" %}
#### Boost Fleet Productivity with Increased Visibility of NPTs

Fine-tune onsite activities with reliable real-time data streams that help uncover high-cost inefficiencies and help lower potential onsite risks.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Value Proposition 3" %}
#### Fine-Tune Pump Plan Efficiencies with Real-Time Monitoring Onsite

Use the same edge computing technology trusted by Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft, with a military-grade edge server that collects and processes data onsite.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Step 4: Isolate Concrete Features _(Feature List)_

Differentiate features from those elements identified in step 1, with insights derived from step 2, and the core driving focus achieved from those value propositions developed in step 3.
