# User Benefits Development

When you've successfully identified a concrete list of features, which have been tested against competitor offerings and against the committed value propositions of the overall platform, you can then take the symptoms and use-cases (uncovered from the Customer Discovery phase) to identify a key benefit for each and every feature.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
When looking at a feature, remember that it is largely a functional description of what the product can _do._ This will help in discovering the actual positive outcome it produces for the customer (which forms your Benefit).
{% endhint %}

### Real-Life Example

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Feature" %}
#### Onsite Edge Server

Process all sensor, service company, and 3rd-party sensor data onsite and close to the source, for true real-time intelligence that aligns all pad activities to a single timestamp.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Benefit" %}
#### Formatted Pad Data

Forget "garbage-in" data and standardize all sources from the pad, no matter how unstructured the format, to spend less time cleaning data and more time learning from it.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
