# Partner Activities

Digital or in-person, community participation acts as an extension of customer discovery while also distributing and implementing all product marketing materials & tactics developed in previous phases. As a media arm in and of itself, it requires consistent activity with key communities that could unlock critical viral coefficients.

#### Example Community Partnership Tactics

* Have talented community members create production-ready apps, utilizing an in-browser IDE that enables expedited development workflows, from low- to no-touch app dependency management features
* Have known instructors in the community offer lesson demos via the in-browser IDE
