# Digital Tactics

Given the affordable and polished tools available today, it's easy to develop strong media assets that not only promote awareness but monitor market interest. These might include:

1. Landing pages which provide downloadable content if provided prospect contact information (fed to CRM funnel)
2. SEO keywords applied to all online assets\
   E.g. Before a contractor, hired for SEO implementation, began their role at Cold Bore Technology, using [a simple (and free) keyword tool](https://www.wordstream.com/keywords) to apply basic keywords to Cold Bore's website garnered an immediate traffic increase and \*3 qualified leads (prior to launch).

Since Cold Bore Technology targets the enterprise market, prospects consume a much longer sales cycle (6 months - 2 years), which makes this count of 3 qualified leads much more significant than it looks.
