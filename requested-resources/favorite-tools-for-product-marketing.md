# Favorite Tools for Product Marketing

### [Beautiful.ai](https://www.beautiful.ai/)

Beautiful.ai is a deck building software that utilizes artificial intelligence to create auto-formatting slides tailored for the content that's added to them. Instead of dragging elements into ad hoc designs (burning through hours of productive time), you can add elements like bullet points and images which reformat the view into optimized layouts. \[Clearly, I had my Product Marketing hat on when I wrote this.]

### [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/xd.html) (and Creative Cloud friends)

Though a bit later to the game, Adobe's release of UI / IxD software has managed to cement itself in my tool arsenal. Not only does it provide fantastic features for actual UI/UX design, including re-usable components which allow switching between different "states", but its sharable links enable multi-type file downloads of logos and immediate clipboard copies of color codes.

### [Monday.com](https://monday.com)

Though I'm currently learning SQL on my own time, when I need a fast relational database for product marketing data, I turn to Monday.com and it's `connect to board` feature which mirrors column data in multiple boards for simplifying complex data organization.&#x20;

It's pretty decent as a work management tool too.

### [Miro Board](https://miro.com)

With it's user-friendly mapping tools and high-performing Jira integrations, Miro Board is one of my go-to tools for collaborative planning in a remote work environment.

### [Carrd.io](https://carrd.io)

Carrd.io has become somewhat of a recent obsession. This website builder has successfully implemented mobile- and desktop-friendly website elements in a clean and sophisticated way that's up and running (with custom domains and traceable analytics) in hours.

### [Dnote Command Line Notebook](https://www.getdnote.com/)

Though it doesn't look sexy at all, I have used dnote's command line notebook for years as it strips down note taking to a simple directory schema and enables fast access to information you need with an editor you're comfortable with. Since I'm not as hardcore as VIM users out there, I use dnote with the Nano editor (and it works just fine!).

### [GraphicRiver.net](https://graphicriver.net/)

Typically used to download graphic elements that can be manipulated for purpose; utilizing the Adobe Creative Suite of tools.

### [Draw.io](https://draw.io)

Organizing formalized systems / value chain mapping

### [MermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)

JS-based diagramming tool that can create sequence diagrams, customer journey maps, gantt chart, and much more. However, I can't seem to get it to work with Angular, so if anyone has suggestions for this, please feel free to contact me! :)

### GitBook

The tool that created this documentation space is pretty great!
