# Solution Space

### What is it?

The Solution Space is an area that focuses on every thing that has to do with the solving the problems identified earlier in this discovery phase. This is not to be confused or isolated to products or toolsets as solutions, but instead recognizes core desired circumstances in a bigger picture before considering any tool or platform.

### Research Questions

Formulating effective research questions for this space can be difficult. However, it's best to start with the most concrete RQs and move on to the more abstract. See the following examples for better understanding:

> _What "Must Be" requirements exist for the customer?_
>
> _What makes them emotionally happiest?_
>
> _What could get a developer a new gig in a completely new framework?_
