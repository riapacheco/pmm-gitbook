# Problem Space

### What is it?

The _Problem Space_ is an area that focuses on the problem itself and every thing associated to it; from its specific obstacles to the different stakeholders involved. By understanding this space we can better understand how our customer thinks instinctually and how such instincts help them arrive at a particular solution.

### Research Questions

I typically focus on flexible research questions that might evolve as insights begin to pour in. These questions might include:

> _What do customers experience as the "Problem" and why?_
>
> _Who are our customers (demographically, psychologically, and geographically) and who / what surrounds them as they experience the problem in focus?_
>
> _What workflow gaps might our customers be experiencing and how do they typically try to overcome them? What do the successful use-cases look like?_
>
> _What is ultimately at stake for the customer and what could they ultimately gain?_
