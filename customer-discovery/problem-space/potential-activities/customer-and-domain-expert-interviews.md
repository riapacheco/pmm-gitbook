# ðŸŽ¤ Customer & Domain Expert Interviews

Customer interviews can be both formal and informal. In either case, it's important not to _lead_ the customer towards certain answers or allow them to _envision_ a product solution themselves. In a customer interview, you might ask

> _Could you tell me what a day looks like for you?_
>
> _What activities \[manage vs monitor vs. actively influence] \[activity/process x]?_&#x20;
>
> _Could you describe the culture of your \[job, community, discipline]?_
>
> _How soon afterwards does \[problem] manifest itself?_
>
> _How have you tried to solve the problem in the past?_

### Insights and Artifacts

At minimum, Problem-Space Customer Interviews should produce:

* Data-infused use-case scenarios
* Pain-point narratives
* The customer's perception of an "ideal state"
* The customer's perception of alternative solutions
* How the customer views stakeholders involved in the space
