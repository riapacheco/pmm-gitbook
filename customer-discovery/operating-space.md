# Operating Space

### What is it?

The _Operating Space_ is the area that focuses on the surrounding industry, work, or cultural environment which might formalize or structure expectations, high- and low-order stakeholders, and mandatory processes.&#x20;

### Research Questions

Some questions to ask during the exploration of this space might include:

> _What stakeholders are involved in the ecosystem and how do we define their roles structurally or professionally?_
>
> _What expected results typically come from \[action X]_
>
> _What implications do certain relationships have, either between stakeholders or entities?_

## Operating-Space Activities

This space often overlaps with discovery activities found in the Problem Space, but differ in terms of perspective. Instead of uncovering potential problems, the insight and understanding of the surrounding operating environment allows for proper **validation** of the potential problems discovered in the Problem Space.

In addition to those activities found in the Problem Space the following activities may be explored:

* Competitor Analysis
* Platform Expectations from Segmented Markets
* Evolving Industry Patterns and Trends
