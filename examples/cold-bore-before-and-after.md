To give those outside the industry a bit of context without getting lost in the weeds, Cold Bore Technology is a data management solution for Oil & Gas companies looking to collect data from all contractors involved in an operation that stimulates well activity for maximized hydrocarbon output (the stuff needed to create pretty much everything around you - not just what's in your fuel take). During this operation, all the activities performed onsite are done entirely by outsourced service companies. These companies use completely different tools & methods for tracking and submitting their data, which really complicates things for the operator when building actionable intelligence systems.
